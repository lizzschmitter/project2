            <p> “It’s huge for our team to come out with that confidence,” said Keon Broxton, who got things rolling with a first-inning homer off J.A. Happ. “Just coming in with this atmosphere was awesome. It was crazy. It gets the blood flowing and helps us come out and play well. </p>

            <p>“Whenever the crowd is into like that, we want to play better and play harder, just to shut them up.”</p>

            <p>Peralta said he used that energy as well to make big pitches when he needed them. He could have made things a lot easier by not grooving a pair of 0-2 fastballs that Troy Tulowitzki pounded for RBI doubles but other than that Peralta kept the Blue Jays under control.</p>

            <p>“I felt like that was my opening day,” said Peralta, who allowed five hits and four walks in six innings but only three runs, in large part because of seven strikeouts. “It felt like it. There was a lot of energy. The crowd was loud. I love pitching in games like that.</p>

            <p>“That’s not an easy lineup. They can really score some runs. I made some big pitches when I had to. We scored some runs early</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="column_two">
            <p>and it's always easier pitching with a lead. The sixth inning was big for me. I knew it would be my last because of my pitch count. I wanted to give it all I had to finish out that inning.”</p>

            <p>Peralta, who staggered out of the gate last season as the Brewers’ opening day pitcher, is 2-0 with a 2.45 ERA after his first two outings. He has set the tone twice now in games the Brewers out-pitched the opposition, including a 6-1 victory over Colorado.</p>

            <p>“Wily probably has a couple of 0-2 pitches he’d like to have back. Other than that, he was pretty darn good,” Counsell said. “He hung in there and got through the sixth, which was a big deal for us. Manny helped him out. Throwing out that runner was a huge play.”</p>

            <p>Every little thing helped in this game, such as the video review in the eighth that reversed a hit-by-pitch with Justin Smoak facing Knebel. The Brewers thought home plate umpire Mike Estabrook got the call wrong and challenged it with success. Knebel struck out Smoak and the one-run lead was safe.</p>

            <p>The ninth inning featured a great battle between Feliz and Josh Donaldson,</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="column_three">
            <p>who ignored a heel injury to come off the bench and pinch hit. They locked horns for seven pitches with Feliz eclipsing 100 mph before finally striking him out.</p>

            <p>“I’m just thankful my arm is healthy,” said Feliz, who also channeled Johnny Cueto with some whirling-dervish deliveries. “I just come out and compete. I don’t really worry about speed. I just try to get outs.”</p>

            <p>Another big contributor was Domingo Santana, who shook out of a first-week slump with a RBI single and home run. The homer also provided some comic relief when new Brewers reliever Jared Hughes did a face plant trying to catch the ball.</p>
                
            <p>“I said, ‘I’m going to catch this thing,’” said Hughes. “I planted my foot to go for it and before I knew it, I was on the ground. I got up and walked away, hoping nobody would see it. But everybody did.”</p>

            <p>A nice win on the road made it easier to laugh about that pratfall.</p>
